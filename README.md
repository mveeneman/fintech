### Simple stock predictor using linear regression

- Step 1 - Go to Yahoo Finance and find a stock price that you want to predict. Click on historical data, then download the CSV of that stocks price history https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL  

- Step 2 - Use Scikit learn to try out 3 different types of regression models to predict the price of that stock for a future date. See the scikit learn docs to see all the different types of regression models you can easily build (i.e quadratic, linear, lasso, ridge, etc.)

- Step 3 - Visualize your result using matplotlib or another plotting library of your choice
